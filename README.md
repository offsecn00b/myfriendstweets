myfriendstweets.py

This is a simple script utilizing tweepy library to download all n of your friends tweets. 

I found this useful when I thought I had saved a tweet last month but I guess I had not.

I discovered that its not easy to go back that far in time using the website and the only logical 
way to do it was with the api. 

This script dumps your the tweets of the people you follow to a csv file. CSV can then be searched
and sorted anyway you like.
